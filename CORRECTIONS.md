# Corrections and Version History

## v0.2 – December 2025 (Corrected)

### What Changed
- Removed unverified experimental claims from v0.1
- Replaced projections with verified, reproducible experiments
- Added explicit methodological note documenting the error and correction

### Why
An AI collaborator generated detailed experimental results with high confidence for experiments that were never conducted. These results were not independently verified prior to the v0.1 release.

Upon discovery, the author:
1. Removed all unverified claims
2. Conducted real experiments
3. Documented the failure transparently

### Status
- v0.2 results are verified and reproducible
- Code paths for additional experiments remain future work

This correction exemplifies the necessity of epistemic humility in AI-assisted research.
